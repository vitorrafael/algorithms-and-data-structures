- Delete an item: Get rid of the item, creating a "hole" in the tree.
    * Put the last item there, making sure that the heap properties are valid;
    * Time complexity:
       # Deleting the root node O(1) + reconstruction O(logN) = O(logN)
       # Deleting an arbitrary node O(N) + reconstruction O(logN) = O(N)
