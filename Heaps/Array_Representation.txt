Binary Heap: Maximum Heap
    - The root node is always the mode with highest value;
    - The important concepts is that the parent is always bigger than its children;
    - Numbered in sequential order;
    - Array representations:
        * The indexes will be assigned to every node in the heap;
    - Given a parent node i:
        * Left Child = 2i + 1;
        * Right Child = 2i + 2;
    - Building a heap:
        * Insert the data and check if the heap properties are met;
        * If they are violated we have to reconstruct the heap -> Heapify proccess
    - Time complexities:
        * Construct a heap: O(N)
            # We have to reconstruct the heap if its properties are violated;
                O(N) + O(logN) = O(N)
