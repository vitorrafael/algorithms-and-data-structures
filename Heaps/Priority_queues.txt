Priority Queue:
    - Abstract data type;
    - Every item has an priority value;
    - An element with high priority is served before an element with lower priority;
    - Usually implemented with heaps;
    - Can be implemented with self balancing trees as well;
    - Very similar to queues;
        * Get the next item -> The highest priority element is retrieved first;
        * No FIFO structure;
