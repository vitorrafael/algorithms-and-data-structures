HEAPS:
    - Binary Tree with tree children;
    - Two binary heap types:
        * Min heap:
            # The keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children;
            # The lowest key is the root node
        * Max heap:
            # The keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children;
            # The highest key is the root node
    - Applications:
        * Dijkstra's algorithm, Prims algorithm
    - Efficient application of piority queues
    
    PROPERTIES:
        1.) Completeness -> we construct the heap from left to right across each row;
