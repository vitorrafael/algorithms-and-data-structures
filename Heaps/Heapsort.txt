HEAPSORT
    - Comparison-based sorting algorithm;
    - Use heap data structure to find the maximum;
    - Bit slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort;
    - More favorable worst-case: O(NlogN)
    - In-place algorithm, but not a stable sort;
    - Does not need aditional memory;
    - Problems: We have to construct a heap first -> O(N)
    
    * Keep swapping the root node with the last element and also mantain the heap properties;
    * After swapping with the root:
        - Consider the last item to be sorted: no longer part of the tree;
        - Check if it is a valid heap;
        - Running time:
            Consider N items + have to make some swappings if necessary
                            O(N*logN)
