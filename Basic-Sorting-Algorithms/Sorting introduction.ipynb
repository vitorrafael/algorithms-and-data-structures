    "   * Puts elements of an array in a certain order;\n",

    "   * **String, characters** -> Alphabetical ordering\n",
    "   * Two types:\n",

    "           - Bubble sort;\n",
    "           - Insertion sort;\n",

    "## Lower Bound:\n",
    "   * For sorting **N** items we have to make **logN!** comparisions;\n",
    "   * With Stringling-formula it can be reduced to **N logN*:\n",
    "       - The **Ω(N logN)** time complexity is the lower bound for **_comparision based_** sorting algorithms;\n",
    "       - We can achieve **O(N)** running time with bucker sort or radix sort, but these are not comparison based algorithms;\n",
    "       \n",
    "## Adaptive Algorithms:\n",
    "   * Is an algorithm that chances its behavior based on information available at runtime;\n",
    "   * **Adaptative Sort:** Takes advantage of existing order in its input;\n",
    "   * Benefits from local orders -> sometimes an unsorted array contains sequences that are sorted by default **->** Faster Algorithm;\n",
    "   * Most of time: we just have to modify existing sorting algorithms in order to end up with an adaptative one\n",
    "   * **The more presorted the input is, the faster it is sorted;**\n",
    "   * It is commom to have nearly sorted sequences;\n",
    "   * Heapsort, merge sort **->** Not Adaptive Algoritms;\n",
    "   * Shell sort **->** Adaptive Algorithm;"
