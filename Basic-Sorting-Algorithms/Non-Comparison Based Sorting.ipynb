    "## Counting Sort\n",
    "   - Operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value;\n",
    "   - We assume the values to be **integers;**\n",
    "   - Using arithmetic on those counts to determine the postions of each key value in the output sequence;\n",
    "   - Suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items;\n",
    "   - It can be used as a subroutine in **radix sort;**\n",
    "   - **Running Time: O(N+k)**\n",
    "   - N -> Number of items to be sorted;\n",
    "   - k -> Difference between the maximum and the minimum key values;\n",
    "   - More recommend when the variation if not greater than the number of items;\n",

    "       2. The value in the array will be the index of the temporary array. We increment the counter there\n",
