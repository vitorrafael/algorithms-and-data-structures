    "### Motivation:\n",
    "    * Store a key value pairs;\n",
    "    * PROBLEM: Arrays transforms any key into indexes, this is why hashfunctions came to be;\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Basics:\n",
    "    * Balance BST -> O(logN) for several operations;\n",
    "    * In hashtables we can achieve O(1);\n",
    "    * h() functions maps keys to indexes in an array;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In general we have n items to be storem + m buckets in which we can store them\n",
    "    Problem: Keys are not always nonnegatives integers, so we have to do prehashing in order to map string keys to indexes of an array;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Key Space -> Buckets;\n",
    "    Relationship between the keys and the array slots;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Hashing: We can map a certain key of any type to a random array index;\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Hash Function\n",
    "    - Distribute the keys uniformly into buckets;\n",
    "    - n: number of keys;\n",
    "    - m: number of buckets;\n",
    "    - h(x) = n % m\n",
    "    - We should use prime numbers for both to make sure the distribution of the generated indexes will be uniform;\n",
    "    - String keys: Calculate the ASCII value for each character, add them up -> make % modulo"

    "### Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Two keys mapped to the same bucket;\n",
    "   - Solutions:\n",
    "       1. **Chaining**: Store both values at the same bucket with linked lists;\n",
    "       2. **Open addressing**: Generate a new index for the item;\n",
    "   - Open addressing > chaining:\n",
    "       - If there are many collision, the chaining solution blocks the O(1) time complexity. Moreover, it needs more memory due to the references.\n",
    "   - **Open Addressing**: If a collision occurs we find an empty slot instead:\n",
    "        * **Linear Probing**: Try the next slot until we find an empty one;\n",
    "        * **Quadratic Probing**: Try slots 1, 2, 4, 8 far;\n",
    "        * **Rehashing**: Hash the result again in order to find an empty slot;\n",

    "   - **Load Factor**: Number of entries divided by the number os slots/buckets;\n",
    "        - N/M\n",
    "        - 0 if the hashtable is empty;\n",
    "        - 1 if the hashtable is full;\n",
    "        - **Load factor is approximately 1**: Nearly full, the performance will be decrease, the operations will be slow;\n",
    "        - **Load factor is approximately 0**: Nearly empty, there will be a lot of memory wasted; \\\n",
    "        **SOLUTION**: DINAMIC RESIZING\n",
    "        \n",
    "- **DINAMIC RESIZING**:\n",
    "    - Performance depends of the load factor;\n",
    "    - Space-time tradeoff is important: the solution is to resize table, when its load factor exceeds given threshold;\n",
    "    - Java: Load factor > 0.75 -> Hashmap automatically resized;\n",
    "    - **Python**: The threashold is 0.66:\n",
    "        - Hash values depend on thable's size so hashes of entries are changed when resizing and algorithm can't just copy data from old storage to the new;\n",
    "        - Resizing takes **O(N)** to complete, where _n_ is a number of entries of the table. This may make dynamic-sized hash tables inappropriate for real-time applications.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- **APPLICATIONS**:\n",
    "    - Databases: Sometimes search trees, sometimes hashing is better;\n",
    "    - Counting given word accurence is a particular document;\n",
    "    - Storing data + lookup tables (password checks);\n",
    "    - Lookup tables in huge networks (lookup for IP addresses);\n",
    "    - The hashing technique can be used for substring search -> **_Rabin-Karp Algorithm_**.\n",
