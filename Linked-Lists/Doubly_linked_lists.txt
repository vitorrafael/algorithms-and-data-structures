PROBLEMS:
    - You can go to the next node but can't return to the previous one.
    Solution:
        Doubly Linked List: The node class has two references, one pointing to the next node and another to the previous node.
        So you can get from everywhere to everywhere, which is not so memory friendly because there are many lots of eferences.
        There is no need to track the previous node during the iterations
