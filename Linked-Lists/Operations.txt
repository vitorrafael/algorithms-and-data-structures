+ Insertion: Insert items at the beginning of the linked list:
    - Just update the references;
    - Time Complexity: O(1).
    
+  Insertion: Insert items at the end of the linked lists:
    - Traverse the whole linked list to find the last node: O(N);
    - Last Node: Points to NULL;
    - Update the reference of the last node: O(1);
    - Time Complexity: O(1) + O(N) = O(N).
    
+ Remove: Remove item at the beginning:
    - There is no need to search the item;
    - Just update the references accordingly;
    - Time Complexity: O(1).
    
+ Remove: Remove item at a given point:
    - Search for the given item: O(N);
    - The previous node should point to the next node;
    - Time Complexity: O(N).
