SEARCH:
    - The search operations yields the same results for both;
    - ArrayList search operation speed > LinkedList search operation;
    - Arrays can use random access: O(1)
    - Linked list: O(N)
    
    ArrayList is better for this operations because it has a index based system for its elements. On the other hand LinkedList requires iterating.
    
DELETION:
    - LinkedLists remove operation from the beginning takes O(1)
    - ArrayList remove operation in the beginning takes O(N), removing the last item takes O(1)
    - On average there is the need to reconstruct the array when removing.
    
    LinkedList is better for this operation because it operates with pointers.
    
MEMORY MANAGEMENT:
    - Arrays do not need any extra memory;
    - LinkedLists requires extra memory due the references/pointers;
    
    Arrays are better.

Search                      O(N)   |  O(1)
Insert at the start         O(1)   |  O(N)
Insert at the end           O(N)   |  O(1)
Waste Space                 O(N)   |    0
