# algorithms-and-data-structures

   The **"Algorithms and Data Structures"** course instructed by Balazs Holczer on Udemy talks about the implementation of data structures such as **Arrays**, **Linked Lists**, **Heaps**, **Stacks**, **Queues**, **Graphs**, **Binary Search Trees**, **Associatives Arrays**, and **Dictionaries** in *Python*.
  \
  \
  Moreover, Balazs also talks about the *time complexity* - O( ) - of each data structure operations.
  \
  \
  The course also introduces algorithms in Python. Some of the algorithms teached are:
  * Dijkstra's algorithm;
  * Bellman-Ford algorithm;
  * Sorting algorithms.
