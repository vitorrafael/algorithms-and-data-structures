Arrays are data structures,
a collection of elements or values each one identified by an array
index or key

    - Index starts at zero
    - Indexes -> random access is possible
    
Multidimensional arrays: Very important in mathematical
related computations (matrixes)
    numbers[][] -> two dimensional array
        - First parameter -> Row
        - Second parameter -> Column

Most Programming Languages arrays stores only one type

They can have as many dimensions as we want;
Dinamic array: Size changes dinamically;

Applications: lookup tables / hashtables, heaps

ADVANTAGES:
    - Random Access: getitem(int index) returns the value
    within the given key on constant time complexity: O(1)
    - Easily implemented and used
    - Very fast
    - Used in applications when we want to add items over and over again
    and we want to take items with given indexes

DISADVANTAGES:
    - We have to know the size of the array at compile-time: so it's not
    so dynamic data structure
    - If it is full we have to create a bigger one and copy the values
    one by one -> reconstructing it is O(N) time complexit
    - It's not able to store items with different types
