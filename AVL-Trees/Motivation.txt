What is the motivation behind balance binary trees?

    - Linked lists: Quite easy to implement
        * Stores lots of pointers;
        * O(N) search operation time complexity;
        
    - Binary Search Trees: O(N) cam be reduced to O(logN) time complexity
        * If the tree is unbalanced: the operations become slowers;
       
    - Balanced Binary Trees: AVL trees or red-black trees
        * They are guaranteed to be balanced;
        * O(logN) guaranteed;
