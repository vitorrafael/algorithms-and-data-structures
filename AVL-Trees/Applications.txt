AVL Sort:
    - We can use this data structure to sort items;
    - Insert the N items wanted to be sort;
    - In order traversal:
        * Insertion: O(N*logN);
        * In-Order Traversal: O(N)
        * Overall Complexity: O(N*logN)
            |-> Because you have to insert an item
            
Applications:
    - Databases with a lot of look-ups and not so many deletions or insertions;
    - Loop-up tables are usually implemented with the help of hashtables but AVL trees support more operations in the main;
    - Red-Black Trees are a bit more popular because for AVL trees we have to make several rotations;
