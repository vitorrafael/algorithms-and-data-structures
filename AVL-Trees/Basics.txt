- The running time of BST operations depends on the height of it: a balaced tree gets the best performance;
- AVL Trees:
    * Created in 1962 by two russian computer scientist;
    * The heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one;
    * AVL trees are faster than red-black tree because they are more balanced;
    * OS relies heavily on these data structures;
    * Most operations are the same as BST;
    * Every node can have at most 2 children like the BST;
    * Same insertion operation but checks wheter the tree is unbalanced or not;
    * Deletion operation is the same;
    * Maximum/minimum finding operations are the same as well;

    Space     O(N)      |       O(n)
    Insert    O(log n)  |       O(log n)
    Delete    O(log n)  |       O(log n)
    Search    O(log n)  |       O(log n)
