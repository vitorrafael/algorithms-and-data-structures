* Red-Black Trees:
    - Linux kernels relies heavily on this data structure;
    - Insertion is fast because it's not rigidly balance;
    - For an insert intensive task, use a Red-Black tree;
    - C++ STL: map, multimap multiset;
    - Java: java.util.TreeMap, java.util.TreeSet.
    
* AVL Trees:
    - Rigidly balanced;
    - Faster look-ups;
    - For a look-up intensive taks use an AVL Tree;
    - Insertion/deletion is not so fast due to the necessity to keep rebalancing the tree.
