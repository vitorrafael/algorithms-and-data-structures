QUEUES:

    - Abstract data type;
    - Basic Operations: enqueue(), dequeue() and peek();
    - FIFO structure: first in first out;
    - It can be implmented with dynamic arrays or linked lists;
    - Important when implementing BFS algorithm for graphs;
    
Operations:
    - Enqueue:
        * Add a new item to the end of the queue;
        * Time Complexity: O(1)
        
    - Dequeue:
        * Simply remove the item start at the beginning of the queue;
        * Time Complexity: O(1)
        
    - Peek:
        * Returns the starting item value without removing it.
        
APPLICATIONS:
    - Threads are stored in a queue;
    - CPU scheduling;
    - Asynchronous data;
    - IO buffers;
    - Operational research applications or stochastic models.
